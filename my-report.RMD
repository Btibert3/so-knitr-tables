title: "Test Table CSS"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: NULL
    style: flat-table.css

I want to be able to style my tables with CSS. From the looks of it, I should be able to do that 
through the use of `CSS` and `knitr:kable`.  


```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
mt_head = head(mtcars[, 1:5])
```

I want to be able to style my table just like one found [here](http://codepen.io/njessen/pen/naLCv)


```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mt_head, "html", table.attr='class="table1"')
```

## Proposed Workflow

1.  Build the RMD File as if you were writing an email report
2.  Ensure that the `CSS` file used to style the output is responsive  
3.  Email the report using `mailR`

Yes, it's that simple, and if you are a `CSS` styling wizard, you should be able to create some amazing 
workflows with just `R Markdown` and `mailR`.
