This repo contains the answer to my question on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24254552/knitr-style-table-with-css).  

By combining `R Markdown` and the `mailR` package, this repo highlights how to compile `RMD` files into `HTML` using `knitR` and CSS styling.  From there, we can leverage the output and distribute the results to our colleagues through email using the `mailR` package.
